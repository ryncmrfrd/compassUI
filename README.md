# ðŸ“Œ Achive Notice
This repo has been archived as a record of the things I made when I was learning to code throughout highschool. 
Read on for a quick guide and retrospective, otherwise you can check out my current projects on my website.

# ðŸ§­ Compass
This is one of the first websites I ever built. Written in pure HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JS, it is a simple static page modeled after [Compass](https://www.compass.education/), a school management platform which was in use at my highschool at the time.

Evidently, I didn't write all of the CSS myself, and employed the [Picnic CSS](https://picnicss.com/) libray for the bulk of the stylesheet. The small amount of javascript in the page updates the `#date` element to add today's date to the `innerHTML`, which seemed like absolue magic at the time. 

I love to revisit things like this from time to time to see how far I've come ðŸ˜„.
